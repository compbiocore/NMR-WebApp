# NMR-WebApp

This repository currently tracks the development of the NMR web app, which containerizes and pulls together nmrbase, nmrdock, and MySQL via docker compose to offer a fully functional web page for the processing, storage, and analysis of NMR data. 

Note: This currently uses an updated image for the processing and analysis of NMR data, which can be found here: https://hub.docker.com/r/jlaw2677/nmrdock_update
